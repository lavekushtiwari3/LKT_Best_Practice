### Assignment: Create Azure VMs with NICs using Terraform

**Objective:** 

Write a Terraform configuration to deploy multiple Azure Virtual Machines, each with its own Network Interface Card (NIC). Utilize the `foreach` and `for` constructs to dynamically create the VMs and NICs based on a list of configurations. Retrieve VM username and password from an Azure Key Vault and use a data block to get the subnet ID.

**Requirements:**

1. **Define Variables:** 
   - Create a variable for VM configurations including name, size, and NIC name.

2. **Retrieve Secrets and Subnet ID:**
   - Use a `data` block to get the VM username and password from an Azure Key Vault.
   - Use a `data` block to fetch the subnet ID for network configuration.

3. **Create NICs and VMs:**
   - Use the `foreach` construct to create a Network Interface Card (NIC) for each VM.
   - Use the `foreach` construct to create a Virtual Machine for each configuration, linking it to the corresponding NIC.

4. **Resource Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that the VMs are properly associated with their respective NICs and the subnet.

**Deliverables:**

- A Terraform configuration file (`main.tf`) that implements the above logic.
- Proper configuration for fetching secrets from Azure Key Vault and using data blocks to get subnet ID.

**Instructions:**

1. Define the necessary provider and variable configurations.
2. Use `data` blocks to retrieve the VM username, password, and subnet ID.
3. Implement `foreach` loops to create NICs and VMs.
4. Ensure each VM is associated with its respective NIC and subnet.

**Note:** Make sure to configure Azure credentials and adjust any other necessary settings for your environment.
